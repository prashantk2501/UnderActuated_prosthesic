# UnderActuated_prosthesis
This is an open-source under-actuated myoelectric prosthetic hand. Please cite the corresponding research paper: "Design and validation of an under-actuated prosthetic hand with adaptive force magnification."

The developed device uses a novel underactuation mechanism and a single actuator to move the fingers. The user need not to choose between mutiple grips to grasp the object. The device is having adaptive grasping capabilities. The grasp force of the device can be controlled by controlling the strength of the EMG input signal from the user. The repsository contains all the necessary required to build the device.

The prosthetic device can be easily rapid prototyped with 3D printers and common mechanical components. This allows it to be produced as a complete myoelectric system for less than $200.
